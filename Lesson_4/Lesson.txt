# For else Loop
# For else state is different from the normal for loop
# because it has an else statement that executes when the loop has finished 
# iterating and there is no exit out of the loop 

successful = False
for number in range(3):
    print("Attempt")
    if successful:
        print("Successful")
        break
else:            
    print("Attempted three times and failed")

# Nested Loop
# In nested loops the outer loops run first and the inner loop
# iterates out before control moves over the to the outer loop and it continues like that
# until the outer loop finish executing
for x in range(5):
    for y in range(3):
        print(f"({x}, {y})")

# Infinite Loop

# Infinite loops would continue to run as long as a condition is true

# while True:
#     command = input("> ")
#     print("ECHO",  command)
#     if command.lower() == "quit":
#         break

# Be aware of infinte loops because they run forever so have a way
# to jump out of them and this can cause lots of problem because
# if your program consumes lots of memory, it can run out of memory and crash
