# Conditional operators for Strings

# print("bags" < "baggie")
# print("bag" > "BAG")
# print(ord("g"))
# print(ord("s"))

# Conditional Statements

# temperature = 18

# Not operator

# high_income = True
# good_credit = False
# student = False

# print(not high_income)
# print(not good_credit)
# print(not student)

# OR

# In Or operator one of them must be correct
# print(high_income or good_credit)

# In AND operator both must be true
# print(high_income and good_credit)

# if high_income and good_credit or not student:
#     print("Eligible")

#     print("Not Eligible")

# Loops (for, While, for else, nested loop)

# Loops are used to create repetition.
# When you want to run a task multiple times we use a for .
# The Loop executes for the number of iteration

# for number in range(1, 10):
#     print(number)

# for letter in "Python Programming":
#     print(letter)

# Print all even numbers from 1 to 20

# for number in range(1, 21):
#     if number % 2 == 0:
#         print(number)

# for number in range(2, 21, 2):
#     print(number)

# Assignment
# Write a Passeword protecting system with the following protection

# Assignment
# Attempted one time
# Attempted two times, One Attempt Left
# Attempted three times, Sim Locked

# While Loop

# While Loop
# We use while loop to repeat something as long as a condition is true

# number = 1

# while number <= 100:
#     print(number)
#     number = number * 4

# command = ""
# while command.lower() != "quit":
#     command = input(">")
#     print("ECHO", command)
